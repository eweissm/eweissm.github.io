During my time at Rosotics inc., a startup looking to develop induction-based additive manufacturing for use in aerospace superstructures, I was tasked to work on the Mantis project, later renamed M1X. The goals of the project were (1) to develop an induction based additive manufacturing (AM) process for high volume and safe manufacturing of aluminum components, (2) to develop a machine which could carry this print head, and (3) to convert these developments into a marketable product. Below you will find a brief discussion of the efforts that have gone into meeting these goals.
Print Head Technology
	By far the most challenging aspect of the project was converting the sparse academic information that existed for induction-based metal AM into a marketable technology ready for aerospace applications. The work required for this endeavor is far too extensive to fully detail in this portfolio (it has been a multi-year endeavor), however as a quick summary this process included:
•	The determination of aluminum alloys compatible with our process
•	The determination of compatible nozzle and substrate materials.
•	The optimization of our induction parameters (current, frequency, and coil geometry) using surface optimization in COMSOL Multiphysics
•	Explorations of process parameters (operating temperature, feed stock diameter, mass flux, substrate material, nozzle material, shielding gas, and auxiliary heat sources)
•	Continual refinement of the experimental setup and of process reliability
