**Harmonic Drive**
Shown below is a 3D printed harmonic gearbox capable of a 25:1 reduction for a Nema-17 stepper motor. The second image is a cross section showing the elliptical spline (orange), the flex-spline (pink), and the circular spline which doubles as the casing (green). 
This project was deceptively challenging as the flex-spline was printed using a relatively cheap FDM printer. Thus, the low tolerance and interference required to make a reliable harmonic drive necessitated a substantial amount of testing and refinement.

**Compact Planetary Gearbox**
This is a single stage planetary gear box designed for use on a 6 DOF robotic arm. The gearbox offers an inline integrated 5:1 reduction that could be used on the wrist or forearm joints of a 6 DOF robot arm in a compact package. The design is optimized for FDM printing to minimize required supports.

**Slew Drive**
This is a 3D printed slew drive with a 132:1 gear reduction meant to be driven by a Nema-17. As can be seen above under Print Head Technology, the slew drive was co-opted at Rosotics into the test stand we used for the print head development. The model used at Rosotics has some additions to allow it to be leveled and to better survive the high temperature environment.
