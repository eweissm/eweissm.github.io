The Stewart platform is a 6 DOF kinematic manipulator capable of supporting tremendous loads over many design modes. Shown below is a Stewart platform (made from 3D printed and laser cut parts) controlled by an Arduino connected to a custom designed breakout PCB. The servo angles are computed on Python (see custom GUI below) and then communicated to the Arduino through serial communication.
See https://github.com/eweissm/StewartPlatfromKinematicsSolver for Python code for the inverse kinematics solver.
