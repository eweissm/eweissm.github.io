The objective of this section of my portfolio is to express to the reader my sincerity when I state that engineering is my lifelong passion. I hope to achieve this goal by demonstrating that even from a young age, I was designing, building, and testing. It is important to note that what I show in this section is not demonstrative of my current capabilities and that many of the designs presented are riddled with flaws generated by a naive kid. However, from each flaw I learned and grew as a designer to become the engineer I am today. Additionally, I am only showing one of the many projects I worked on as a child, as discussing all the partially complete projects started by an easily distracted child would be unnecessarily verbose.	
Here I present a project I took on in the summer between the end of middle school and the start of high school. I had seen on the internet that potassium nitrate (stump remover) mixed with powdered sugar could make a rocket propellent. So, knowing virtually nothing about rocketry, I decided I would build my own solid rocket motors. A couple of runs to the hardware store later and some pleading with my mom, I had a motor packed full of the mixture and was off to the park. To no surprise, when I lit the motor, I watched a PVC tube full of rocket fuel slowly burn. However, instead of giving up I decided to standardize my manufacturing and to optimize the motor design through empiricism. I taught myself how to code Arduino, bought a load cell, and built the force measurement platform shown in figure 28. I then spent hours and hours in the middle of the Arizona summer outside in my backyard as I built motor after motor, analyzing different parameters like fuel mixture ratios and nozzle throat diameter. The results of these experiments are shown in figure 29. Clearly my data had some large variability, but it was good enough for me back then and I used that data to build the rocket shown in figure 30. You will note that this rocket is not melting but is actually flying!
