excerpt: 'This paper investigates the feasibility of designing a transoceanic supersonic business jet to succeed the Concorde, addressing key challenges such as range, safety, fuel efficiency, and route accessibility. Adopting a multidisciplinary approach, we propose a next-generation luxury aircraft incorporating advanced technology, including a non-afterburning turbofan engine with a simple normal shock inlet. We have developed an 8-passenger design that can fly across the North-Atlantic at supersonic speeds. During the design process, it was found that incorporating a wing with an average sweep of 50° to 55° delays the onset of drag rise just past Mach 1. This allows for more efficient transonic and supersonic cruising, as hypothesized by Antony Jameson. Additionally, our design adheres rigorously to 14 CFR § 25 regulations, ensuring compliance with safety standards and operational requirements. Our innovative approach represents a significant step forward in the development of economically viable supersonic transport aircraft.'
